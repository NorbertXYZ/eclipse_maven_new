## The Maven repository for eclipse builds

For version  / tag 4.34 I made a small "correction" in
p2/osgi/bundle/com.sun.jna/5.14.0.v20231211-1200
and added the freebsd aarch64 in MANIFEST.INF, and also copied the freebsd-aarch64 folder com/sun/jna from jna 5.15.0.
Then the compilation under aarch64 was successful.
